## 4) GETTING THE SOURCE CODE

This project's GitHub.net Git repository can be checked out through Git with the following instruction set: 

	> git clone --recursive https://github.com/MadDeCoDeR/Classic-RBDOOM-3-BFG.git

If you don't want to use git, you can download the source as a zip file at
	https://github.com/MadDeCoDeR/Classic-RBDOOM-3-BFG/archive/master.zip

Tip: Make sure to change the file path on line 7 of neo/CMakeLists.txt to the folder path of vcpkg you have installed on your system (if you have it already installed)


## 5) COMPILING ON WINDOWS WITH VISUAL STUDIO

A) Preperation
--------------

1. Download and install Visual Studio (For new Versions make sure the "Desktop Development with C++" component is checked on the installer and the individual component cmake)

2. Download and install DirectX SDK:

	a. For June 2010 Release (Windows XP compatible/Legacy): Download and Install it from Microsoft's website https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109

	b. For Modern DirectX: 
	
	- XInput 9.1.0 and Direct Input comes pre-installed on Windows 7 and later (.dll that the game will load). 
	- XAudio2. It has two versions 2.8 (only for Windows 8 and later) and XAudio 2.9 (backwards compatilble with Windows 7). 
		2.8 like with XInput comes pre-installed with the OS. For 2.9 you must download it. See [7.A](#a-installing-additional-requirements) for more details

3. (Optional if you want to use cmake presets with Visual Studio) Download and install the latest CMake (recommended 3.8 for compile and run out of the box).

5. (Optional if you don't want to use vcpkg) Download the latest stable ffmpeg (5.0) shared from https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases (only 64-bit available) and put them on the game's folder (where the origianal .exe is)


B) Project Configuration and Genenration
-----------------------------------------

For old Versions of Visual Studio.

	1) Generate the VC projects using CMake by doubleclicking a matching configuration .bat file in the neo/ folder.

For Visual Studio 2019 and newer. 

	1) Open the repository folder on Visual Studio and set the CMake source the neo folder (it will prompt you to set it)
	2) Select the desired preset.
		Available Presets:
			64-bit Windows: Actively used, uses OpenGL, OpenAL and XAudio2.9
			64-bit Windows with Vulkan: Expirimental FOR DEVS ONLY. uses Vulkan, OpenAL and XAudio2.9
			32-bit Windows: 32-bit version of the x64-bit windows


C) Compiling Project
--------------------

1. Use the VC solution to compile  what you need:
	Classic-RBDOOM-3-BFG/build(Lib&cpuType)/DoomBFA.sln
	
(NOTE: The pre-built binaries are made wth buildx64 with Retail Profile)

2. Select Desired Profile and compile (either by right clicking the DoomBFA project and selecting 'Build' or by running the debugger (F5))

	Available Profiles:
	------------------
		Debug: No Optimizations and with Debug symbols, used ONLY for debuging
		Release: With Optimizationd and with some Debug elements
		Retail: With Optimizations and without any Debug element, used for distributing pre-build binaries

NOTE: The Working Directory has been set the default install directory of DOOM 3 BFG Edition on C: drive

NOTE 2: By default the launch argument "+set r_fullscreen 0" is used. If you are in a single monitor system is HEAVILY recommented to be left on


## 6) COMPILING ON GNU/LINUX

A) Preperation
--------------

1. Make sure you have installed GNU GCC on your system.

	In order to check it, open a terminal and type 'gcc -v', if it returns an output then it is intstalled.
	
	If it doesn't then try to install gcc using the package manager of your system (Some distros might support also the 'build-essentials' which might include some addons)
	NOTE: You need GCC 11 or newer in order to compile the code

1. Install required packages in order to compile and run the game:
 
	On Debian or Ubuntu:

		> apt-get install cmake libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl-dev libx11-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev nasm
	
	On Fedora

		// ffmpeg-devel is found in the rpm-fusion repo. Can be enabled from Gnome Software if not already enabled
		
		> dnf install cmake gcc-c++ freeglut-devel mesa-libGLU-devel libXmu-devel libXi-devel mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXft-devel libXext-devel libdecor-devel wayland-devel nasm autoconf libtool perl python3-jinja2 libXrandr-devel libXxf86vm-devel vulkan-headers wayland-protocols-devel libXfixes-devel libXcursor-devel libXi-devel
	
	On ArchLinux 
	
		> sudo pacman -S cmake
	
	On openSUSE (tested in 13.1)
	
		> zypper in cmake
	
		NOTE: SDL 1 is not so well supported and it's missing various features and optimizations
		For SDL 2 replace "libSDL-devel" with "libSDL2-devel".
		"libffmpeg1-devel" requires the PackMan repository. If you don't have that repo, and don't want to add it, remove the "libffmpeg1-devel" option and compile without ffmpeg support.
		If you have the repo and compiles with ffmpeg support, make sure you download "libffmpeg1-devel", and not "libffmpeg-devel".
	
	Instead of SDL2 development files you can also use SDL1.2. Install SDL 1.2 and add to the cmake parameters -DSDL2=OFF
	
	SDL2 has better input support (especially in the console) and better 
	support for multiple displays (especially in fullscreen mode).
	

B) Project Configuration and Genenration
----------------------------------------

Without cmake presets:

1.To Generate the Makefiles using CMake (old and deprecated):

	> cd neo/
	> ./cmake-linux-<profile>.sh (recommended retail profile)
	
	
With CMake presets (new and currently used):

Terminal:

	> cd neo/
 	> cmake -B ../build_<profile> --preset=linux-<profile>
	

CMake GUI (also applies to Windows):

	- Open GUI
	- Select the neo folder as source
	- The dropdown below the source will become active
	- Select profile
	- Press Config and then Generate

Visual Studio Code IDE (might apply to other IDE's with similar CMake support):

	- Make sure you have installed Microsoft's C/C++ - Extension Pack
	- Open the repository folder
	- Select desired Profile

Available Profiles: See [5.C.2](#available-profiles)

C) Compiling Project
--------------------
	
1.To Compile DOOM BFA

	> cd ../build
	> make (add DoomBFA in order to skip game.so's compilation)
	
	or
	
	> make -j <number of CPU cores> (for faster compiles)

## 8) OVERALL CHANGES

- Flexible build system using CMake

- Linux support (32 and 64 bit)

- Win64 support

- OS X support (untested on this fork)

- OpenAL Soft sound backend primarily developed for Linux but works on Windows as well

- Bink video support through FFmpeg

- PNG image support

- Soft shadows using PCF hardware shadow mapping

	The implementation uses sampler2DArrayShadow and PCF which usually
	requires Direct3D 10.1 however it is in the OpenGL 3.2 core so it should
	be widely supported.
	All 3 light types are supported which means parallel lights (sun) use
	scene independent cascaded shadow mapping.
	The implementation is very fast with single taps (400 fps average per
	scene on a GTX 660 ti OC) however I defaulted it to 12 taps using a Poisson disc algorithm so the shadows look
	really good which should give you stable 100 fps on todays hardware (2014).

- Changed light interaction shaders to use Half-Lambert lighting like in Half-Life 2 to 
	make the game less dark. https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half_Lambert

- True 64 bit HDR lighting with adaptive tone mapping and gamma-correct rendering in linear RGB space

- Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Antialiasing
	For more information see "Anti-Aliasing Methods in CryENGINE 3" and the docs at http://www.iryoku.com/smaa/

- Filmic post process effects like Technicolor color grading and film grain

- Additional ambient render pass to make the game less dark similar to the Quake 4 r_forceAmbient technique

- Support for Classic DOOM launch arguments

- Extended mod support for Classic DOOM (Vanilla + Partial BOOM compatibility)

- Restored Flashlight from the original DOOM 3 (2004)

- Revmaped settings with more options on both DOOM 3 and the Classic DOOM games

## 9) CONSOLE VARIABLES

Check here: https://github.com/MadDeCoDeR/Classic-RBDOOM-3-BFG/wiki/3.-New-Parameters

## 10) KNOWN ISSUES

- In some cases activating both SSAO and Soft Shadows might result in shadow artifacts
- Using the latest AMD Windows Driver (22.7.1 and newer) might result in worse performance than with previous versions (22.6.1 or older)

## 11) BUG REPORTS

DOOM-BFA is not perfect, it is not bug free as every other software.
For fixing as much problems as possible we need as much bug reports as possible.
We cannot fix anything if we do not know about the problems.

The best way for telling us about a bug is by submitting a bug report at our GitHub bug tracker page:

	https://github.com/MadDeCoDeR/Classic-RBDOOM-3-BFG/issues?state=open

The most important fact about this tracker is that we cannot simply forget to fix the bugs which are posted there. 
It is also a great way to keep track of fixed stuff.

If you want to report an issue with the game, you should make sure that your report includes all information useful to characterize and reproduce the bug.

    * Search on Google
    * Include the computer's hardware and software description ( CPU, RAM, 3D Card, distribution, kernel etc. )
    * If appropriate, send a console log, a screenshot, an strace ..
    * If you are sending a console log, make sure to enable developer output:

              DoomBFA.exe +set developer 1 +set logfile 2
			  
		You can find your qconsole.log on Windows in C:\Users\<your user name>\Saved Games\id Software\DOOM BFA\base\

NOTE: We cannot help you with OS-specific issues like configuring OpenGL correctly, configuring ALSA or configuring the network.

## 12) GAME MODIFICATIONS
	
The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code release allows mod editing, in order for it to accept any change in your
mod directory, you should first specify your mod directory adding the following command to the launcher:

"+set fs_game modDirectoryName"

so it would end up looking like: DoomBFA +set fs_game modDirectoryName

Also now you can package your mod in .resource files for more info check: https://github.com/MadDeCoDeR/Classic-RBDOOM-3-BFG/wiki

Classic doom mods are enabled and can be used with the old "-file" parameter like this: RBDoom3BFG -file "classicmod.wad"

IMPORTANT: DOOM-BFA does not support old Doom 3 (2004) modiciations that include sourcecode modifications in binary form (.dll)
You can fork DOOM-BFA and create a new binary (.dll) that includes all required C++ game code modifications.
